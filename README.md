	# Company Interview and Employment Review Platform Database System

  	Company Interview and Employment Review Platform is a proposed platform that
	form users to give reviews related to companies, jobs, and interview processes.
	In the platform, users can share information regarding their employment status,
	qualifications, resume, and their desired job.
	The desired job specification can include fundamental information
	about the salary, job title, position, job location, benefits provided by the job.
	Companies can post about the currently available job offerings
	within their ranks with the pre-requirements they are looking for.
	The platform, in turn, provides the employees and employment seekers
	with possible job suggestions.
